## Undergraduate Thesis - IEEE TQE (Under Review)

This research develops the first hybrid quantum-classical framework using logit distillation to transfer knowledge from classical neural networks to quantum circuits. The work has received 12 preprint citations and was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Mahdy Rahman Chowdhury, **ICO Galileo Galilei Medal Award winner, 2023**.

### Key Contributions

- **First Knowledge Distillation Framework** for quantum machine learning
- **Logit Distillation**: Novel approach to transfer classical knowledge to quantum circuits
- **12 Preprint Citations**: Significant early impact in quantum ML community
- **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple quantum architectures

### Technical Approach

**Core Idea**: Use knowledge distillation to transfer the learned representations from large classical neural networks to resource-efficient quantum neural networks

**Architecture**: Hybrid quantum-classical system with:
- Classical teacher network (pre-trained CNN/Transformer)
- Quantum student network (parameterized quantum circuits)
- Distillation loss matching output distributions

**Framework**: Qiskit, PennyLane, PyTorch, TorchQuantum

**Quantum Hardware**: Tested on IBM Quantum simulators and real quantum devices
