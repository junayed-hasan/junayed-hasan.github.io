## IEEE ICDM 2025 (Oral + Poster)

HadaSmileNet introduces a novel Hadamard-fusion framework that integrates handcrafted facial features with deep learning representations for enhanced genuine smile recognition. This work was accepted for both oral and poster presentation at IEEE ICDM 2025.

### Key Achievements

- **26% Efficiency Gain**: Reduced parameters, training time, and inference latency by 26%
- **Superior Accuracy**: Outperformed multi-task learning baselines while maintaining accuracy
- **Hadamard Fusion**: Novel integration method for handcrafted and learned features
- **Clinical Relevance**: Collaborated with domain experts to ensure real-world applicability

### Technical Approach

**Architecture**: Hadamard product-based fusion of handcrafted Duchenne Marker features and transformer-learned features

**Datasets**: Validated on 4 benchmark smile recognition datasets

**Framework**: PyTorch, Transformers

**Efficiency**: 26% reduction in computational requirements vs. multi-task baselines
