## Alexandria Engineering Journal (2025)

A novel framework combining prompt engineering and domain knowledge integration for early detection of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). By leveraging LLM-guided feature engineering, we achieved improved accuracy in NCD prediction tasks.

### Key Achievements

- **LLM-Guided Feature Engineering**: Integrated domain knowledge through prompt engineering
- **Improved Accuracy**: Outperformed traditional ML baselines on NCD prediction
- **Early Detection Focus**: Designed for proactive healthcare interventions
- **Clinical Validation**: Tested on real-world clinical datasets

### Methodology

**Approach**: 
1. Domain knowledge extraction via LLM prompting
2. Automated feature engineering guided by medical expertise
3. Ensemble learning with engineered features
4. Clinical outcome prediction for NCDs

**Diseases Covered**: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer

**Framework**: GPT-based prompting, scikit-learn, PyTorch
