> **I design efficient machine learning and language technologies for healthcare and low-resource settings.**

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University and an AI researcher focusing on efficiency-centric machine learning, natural language processing, and healthcare applications. I am interested in models that reason, translate, and make predictions under realistic compute, memory, and data constraints.

At Johns Hopkins, I am advised by **[Prof. Anjalie Field](https://anjalief.github.io/)** and work with **[Prof. Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/)** on low-resource machine translation and reference-free evaluation, developing reinforcement learning methods that use paraphrase consensus instead of parallel corpora. As a research intern at **Mayo Clinic** under **[Dr. Thomas Tavolara](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DTnOXg4AAAAJ)**, I build end-to-end clinical ML pipelines for blood utilization forecasting and biomarker detection, with an emphasis on deployable systems that integrate into real hospital workflows.

Previously, at North South University, I completed my undergraduate thesis on hybrid quantum-classical machine learning under **[Prof. Mahdy Rahman Chowdhury](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PxNOguMAAAAJ)**, who received the **ICO Galileo Galilei Medal Award** in 2023. I also worked as an Research Assistant with **[Prof. Nabeel Mohammed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=w5djOYsAAAAJ)** on clinical NLP, smile recognition, and deep metric learning projects including *OptimCLM* and *Shadow Loss*. I currently work with Prof. Mahdy as an AI Research Assistant at Mahdy Research Academy, where I lead projects on model compression, hybrid quantum-classical architectures, and multimodal medical imaging. My work has appeared in venues such as **NeurIPS**, **IEEE ICDM**, **Pattern Recognition Letters**, **International Journal of Medical Informatics**, **PLOS ONE**, and **IEEE Access**, along with several manuscripts currently under review at top-tier conferences and journals.
